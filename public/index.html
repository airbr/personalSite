        <p><code>&quot;use NZ-UK strict spelling&quot;;</code></p>
<p>Recently I received my NZ ITP Associate certificate. An Atlantan may wonder ‘What on earth is an NZ <a href="http://www.knowatlanta.com/feature-stories-on-atlanta/itp-vs-otp/" target="_blank" rel="external">In-The-Perimeter</a> Associate’ !?</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2016/10/Morgan-Murrah-NZ-ITP-Certificate-Associate.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Well ITP actually stands for the Institute of IT Professionals in NZ. <a href="https://iitp.nz/Join/IT-Professionals" target="_blank" rel="external">Associate membership is the most junior and entry level status one can gain, which is accurately my status as a new entrant into the field</a>.</p>
<p>Associate membership is still no small deal- all members are bound by the mandatory <a href="https://iitp.nz/Members/Code-of-Ethics" target="_blank" rel="external">code of ethics</a> in their dealings with others to remain in good standing.</p>
<p>The organi<strong>s</strong>ation has a number of great courses and resources which will admittedly be not as easy to access from the United States and on US Eastern Standard time.</p>
<p>However, I know there are more Kiwi’s than I realize in the USA and even in Atlanta. For example, I had the pleasure of meeting the CEO of <a href="http://www.motim-technologies.com/#leadership" target="_blank" rel="external">Motim Technologies</a> which produces amazing work in AR and with other technologies for very large fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>The opportunities to do business between the two countries is only growing as the world becomes more connected. Still, it is nice to get snail mail and this will hang warmly on my wall. Onwards !</p>

Hello there!

If you are reading this HTML comment I appreciate your efforts to go a bit deeper under the surface of my website and portfolio.

I must give credit to W3Schools for my adaptation of their CSS3 animation at the following URL incorporated into this post: http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp

Silly little CSS animations were something that was fun right at the beginning of my journey into web development and kept me motivated. Ask me about them and Ill know you have taken some time to look over my stuff and have an appreciation for simple fun along the way of gaining harder skills.

        <p>Working in groups is  an unavoidable aspect of life and work and it seems a truism issues commonly arise. For people experienced with group work a lot below may also seem like a truism but I am really happy to recap one particular thing I observed and learned <a href="https://github.com/airbr/park4" target="_blank" rel="external">from a recent group project using Ruby on Rails</a>. You can see the ReadMe for this project on the GitHub at that link.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: Don’t take for granted having a simple system for dividing tasks (or ‘tickets’ as commonly described) and having it viewable for all to see. Trello Boards or whatever people decide to use can save some real headaches and misunderstanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have to clarify what each person is doing such as by asking or repeating yourself the potential for miscommunication increases greatly. Agreeing on a simple (even if it seems cheesy) system such as a Trello board that people can refer to really is an investment, even if it can seem tedious at times. This really came to my attention because one team member had previously worked in a group that <strong>didn’t</strong> do this well and the difference in stress levels was very evident. </p>
<p>One of my fellow developers in this project expressed the difference to us as we began using the <a href="https://trello.com/b/O3ZXyAv8/project4-railsapi" target="_blank" rel="external">Trello board</a>. She described some miscommunication that had occurred in their previous project simply because they weren’t keeping a better track of who was doing what- one team member quickly began to feel like others were doing the work they had claimed, or that their proposed ‘tickets’ were not being acknowledged.</p>
<p>Other things that really stood out from this project was really reaping the benefits of dividing tasks. Early on one person took over the realm of designing the platform- as a result they were able to experiment and make decisions that resulted in a really consistent and quite polished look for a week sprint of a project. </p>
<p>I am really happy with the experience I had overall and look forward to being able to discuss this group experience as I seek new opportunities in web development.</p>

        <p>Recap of UX Design Bootcamp at General Assembly instructed by <a href="https://twitter.com/@playfulpixel" target="_blank" rel="external">Jacklyn Cohen == @PlayfulPixel</a></p>
<p><img src="https://ga-core.s3.amazonaws.com/production/uploads/program/default_image/922/thumb_Building-your-team.jpg" alt="Hello"></p>
<p>On September 10th I attended a one-day <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/user-experience-design-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="external">User Experience Design Bootcamp</a> at the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education?where=atlanta" target="_blank" rel="external">General Assembly campus in Atlanta</a>. I chose this course along with the <a href="https://www.airbridge.ac.nz/2016/08/28/1-day-python-bootcamp-recap/" target="_blank" rel="external">Python Bootcamp</a> as extra courses to take with my in-house credit with GA as a current WDI student. As a current student at GA looking for a new opportunity after graduating I am not really an independent observer of a GA course but will try to write something interesting!</p>
<p>As a summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe this class helped me understand more about the work done by UX professionals and how I could work with someone working in UX in a future development role. </p>
<p>Early on in the course we examined the dismissive stereotype that UX is really just visual design and how people feel about shiny exciting buttons (even as much as I like shiny and exciting buttons). </p>
<p>I would be lying if I hadn’t thought like that about UX occasionally before. However, I have started to see the increasing importance and professional specialization in UX in recent years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>I remembered <a href="https://twitter.com/uxdesignday" target="_blank" rel="external">there was a conference in the city of Dunedin called UX Design day</a> just before I left New Zealand which I was recommended to attend. I also became aware of a website called <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Dark Patterns</a> that critically looks at unethical or exploitative applications of UX which actually I think really focused me to consider the potential power of the craft.</p>
<p>While UX does seem to be an increasingly relevant discipline it was recognized it is still not widely understood/recognized for the variety of work skills involved:<br><img src="http://uxisnotui.com/downloads/with-title.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I now know that UX is indeed bigger than shiny buttons on a UI. For one example, this course made consider the role and scope of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe" target="_blank" rel="external">wireframes in development</a>. In class in WDI we have typically created our own wireframes for our own APP idea’s to meet project specification.</p>
<p>In the course I thought more about how in developing a real world app of any particularly big size quality information would be wanted from the target market to make the wireframes the best fit possible. A wireframe fed from information purely from developers given a description would likely be ignorant of the customers needs/wants and could lead to costly redesigns.</p>
<p>Considering the wider range of work and information gathering such as interviews and focus groups that might go into making and testing a wireframe reminded me of the much larger business context development takes place within.</p>
<p><strong>Instruction</strong></p>
<p>I appreciated being taught by a working professional who was involved in the community. <a href="https://twitter.com/playfulpixel" target="_blank" rel="external">@Playfulpixel</a>‘s style is a practiced teaching style that is also deliberately informal. UX seems to have emerging best practices and methodologies but like many aspects of development it has few traditional ‘constraints’ such as licensing or respected certifications.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of primary sources, less-rigorous secondary processing?</strong></p>
<p>In the class there was an emphasis on quality interviewing practices such as avoiding asking suggestive questions. These practices were stated to ultimately lower the quality of your UX work product which is itself a consideration of how users would experience some product. </p>
<p>However, at the same time there was an emphasis on getting quality primary source information the standard changes quickly when you get to secondary stages of processing the information, where UX specific processes and ideas are applied. You might say it is more of an art made from science.</p>
<p>One questionable concept - which the instructor was convincingly critical of - are “<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="external">Personas</a>“ that are prone to not being validated correctly. Personas are apparently commonly used and considered useful as they can more easily ‘interface’ with the discipline of marketing.</p>
<p>I can certainly see how concepts such as a ‘corporeal’ person or ‘spirit consumer’ or ‘spirit animal’ (maybe the product is for pets…) could take on a life of their own and not actually add much value to a UX process… as well as be open for lampooning.</p>
<p><strong>Scope: Material on <a href="slideshare.net/jacklynburgan">Slideshare</a></strong></p>
<p>Our class had to  work at pace to get through all of the material contained on by the end of the class which we did by skipping making a persona ourself. I can see that it would be difficult to plan content for a one day bootcamp and accurately depict how much work could go into an item of UX work which could span months or years and to study a potentially global market. </p>
<p>I can also see how this course could seem “breezy” who doesn’t see it against the bigger picture of UX. Elements of exercises such as using post-it notes to record points that come up from interviews could seem cheesy and relaxed as opposed to something more “hard” or “technical” like coding or measuring metrics from digital based user interviews/tests. </p>
<p>However, I can see this attitude misses the point that significant and valuable information is still derived from potential customers who have conflicting and sometimes irrational concerns and thoughts. A relaxed and cheesy environment arguably allows a focus on similar drives for food, drink, the restroom and to sleep among the many other lower common denominators that ultimately guide many of our experiences and purchasing decisions. UX seems to seek to really capture that value.</p>
<p>The instructor pointed out in some jobs the work that goes into UX projects including empathy maps, personas and wireframes can take months and years. That various businesses seem to consider these processes valuable enough to justify such investment could also seem to speak for itself.</p>
<h5 id="Groceries…"><a href="#Groceries…" class="headerlink" title="Groceries…."></a>Groceries….</h5><p>Grocery shopping was chosen as an example of a more common denominator example applicable for a ‘all-comers’ classroom setting to try some UX Design for the bootcamp. My result wireframed an app based around notes from interviews the class conducted:</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2016/09/cards.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The ‘insights’ I took from notes following interviews conducted by our tables were very roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone has a level of frustration with grocery shopping (including traffic, parking, putting shopping carts away, lack of shopping carts, selection).</li>
<li>Majority of people still prefer in-store shopping for various reasons than moving to online grocery delivery</li>
<li>Consumers tend to be loyal to stores for a variety of reasons but do not seem to take much concern about particular loyalty schemes such as coupons or cards</li>
</ul>
<p>My wireframe attempts to depict a “Shopping List 2.0” aimed at this type of user that still grocery shops in-store with loyalty to a particular store. This app will intend to reduce the frustration felt by this user by making planning a shopping trip more enjoyable to enhance this store-loyalty.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2016/09/cartwireframe.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The wireframed app includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic shopping cart animations when items are added by swiping grocery items down from a scrolling drop-down menu using material design principles</li>
<li>Minimum three dynamically updated elements including:<ul>
<li>A price sub total for items put into the cart</li>
<li>An indicator as to the actual size and weight of the basket of items</li>
<li>An updated ‘loyalty’ counter indicating the current and potential loyalty savings if this order of items is purchased.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The rationale behind this app is that it to an extent aims to glamorize (or gamify) the simple task of making a shopping list that in-store shoppers typically rely on. It allows the user to get more dynamically updated information in the process with live prices from the store (lets keep this hypothetical heh… my development knowledge is enough now I know this isn’t so easy as it sounds).</p>
<p>I envision potential for targeted loyalty scheme offers via the app, redeemable in person, but only triggered by certain targeted conditions such as composition of the shopping cart or location of the user.</p>
<p><strong>Very Junior Developer thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>On a first gut through, I would consider a lot of what I am describing above being very possible with Angular JS and access to a clean, easy to use API of grocery store data. Nothing stands out as infeasible.</p>
<p>The idea of a digitized, updated ‘shopping list meets shopping cart’ but that does not handle online orders or credit cards or other things makes things a whole lot simpler.</p>
<p>I would consider <a href="www.materializecss.com">Materialize CSS</a> or another material design based framework to the buttons and elements of the page to give a punch and pull feel to the animation of items being added and removed from the shopping cart.</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
<p>9/10 Good one day course, made me think/has some good general takeways, was still a little bit rushed</p>

<p>On Saturday 27th August 2016 I attended the Python Bootcamp at General Assembly in Atlanta in addition to my <a href="https://www.airbridge.ac.nz/2016/08/01/my-schedule-for-the-next-few-months/" target="_blank" rel="external">regular course studies there</a>. As a current full-time student part of our tuition is effectively in-house credit for the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education?" target="_blank" rel="external">pretty wide range of workshops/events GA hosts</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to attend for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Python is not taught in the Immersive Web Development curriculum</p>
</li>
<li><p>I knew Python has wide usage in particular fields and is a common ‘first language’ learned </p>
<ul>
<li>Python is used by students in the Data Immersive program at General Assembly and I had conversations with some of them about their experiences with Python. My prior exposure to it was mainly from my peers at Otago University who were studying science. Research scientists are a large user group of python.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Walking into this bootcamp there were a number of positive/negative ideas which had been shared to me and I wasn’t really informed enough to have an opinion on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>That Python was elegant and easier than other languages (indeed to the point it could spoil you against learning harder languages)</p>
</li>
<li><p>That Python was slow and ‘bloated’ and the reason for its adoption is really just the ease of use that overrides most performance concerns</p>
<ul>
<li>However, there is a related argument/point that in fields such as data science and analytics human resources such as developer time are more scarce than processing power. Hence, sometimes it would be better to have a ‘slow program’ that produces the right result than one that requires more intensive developer time. This point was explicitly made by the instructor as a rationale for using Python despite its performance issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Format of the bootcamp:</strong></p>
<p>The Bootcamp went from 10-4pm with a lunch break. It was taught at a fast pace but with opportunities to catch up as the instructor took time to move around the room to help fix any bugs/installation errors. It was assuring to hear the instructor state getting the development environment set up properly is always the biggest challenge in a classroom environment for coding.</p>
<p>To fix part of this problem we used a cloud-based deployment using <a href="www.c9.io">C9</a> of a <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jupyter</a> notebook to view the Python based course materials. This was to enable the python code in the notebook to be run by computers in the cloud and not be reliant on local internet signal quality. </p>
<p>Nice little starter command:</p>
<p><code>jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --no-browser</code></p>
<p><strong>Cliff notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I really liked <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jupyter</a>. I can see its immediate value in being able to visualize data and ‘show your work’ with chunks of code leading into that visualization on the same page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After the first hour of setting up software and the cloud dev environment we got pretty much straight into it with the basics. A copy of my very first Python code/hello world::</p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np</div><div class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print &apos;Hello World!!&apos;</div><div class="line">Hello World!!</div><div class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+2</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<ul>
<li>We went through major features and aspects of Python vis-a-vis other languages and its quirks. Some interesting ones were:<ul>
<li>Python is dynamically typed language, meaning it executes many things on runtime rather than could be executed during compilation. This can cause various side effects and errors. As one resource put it “if a program is statically typed, you know that certain types of errors are not possible”.</li>
<li>Python has a large version split between user bases of 2.7 and 3.x , and that 2.7 requires a floating point in division is one of the first ‘gotchas’ associated with Python:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="A-‘Gotcha’"><a href="#A-‘Gotcha’" class="headerlink" title="A ‘Gotcha’:"></a><strong>A ‘Gotcha’:</strong></h2><p><strong>In Python 2.7 you may need to add a floating point for numbers to get have decimal usage or else you get some crazy errors/bugs…. this is ‘fixed in Python 3.x:</strong></p>

<p>I can see how some of these apparently tiny but fundamental changes could make things break…</p>
<p>In the class we touched on a lot in the class including usage of type, control flow, modules. Hard to cover it all here.</p>

<p>I barely need to tell <em>anyone</em> who has been anywhere near a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">Javascript For Loop</a> that this is a much more elegant and simple code for this function. You can even get it down to 1-2 lines. Credit where credit is due.</p>
<p><strong>Modules - i.e. Pandas for visualization we saw in class.</strong></p>
<p>In Python we learned that modules really are just blocks of python that will be ‘pre-run’ in your terminal, introducing variables and so forth. They are not asynchronous/dynamically updating modules. </p>
<p>In simple terms this means anytime an update is made to a module a fresh instance of Python is required with that module imported with its incorporated changes.</p>
<p>Even just with the basic importing of Pandas however it was clear how much added functionality became possible for complex visualizations.</p>
<p><strong>Potential application in my open source project:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Parsing XML</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One issue I am considering closely is XML of NZ Legislation as part of an open-source project. It seems Python has some excellent XML parsing libraries that could prove useful for me.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion "></a>Conclusion </h2><p>Python seems a good option for some of my project ideas and I understand why it is widely used in various applications.</p>
<p>The workflow of python applies well to preparing some kind of program, analysis or visualization and having a chance to leave it to process even overnight, later having a chance to tweak it or edit it the following morning, and deliver it to meet a 5pm deadline. You can produce powerful, high quality work- but it takes place within some boundaries.</p>
<p>This workflow does not seem apply as well to a dynamic, live, web development environment where latency in general should not exceed three seconds. This challenge is heightened as some web applications should be able to meet the needs of potentially millions of users at an ‘enterprise’ level.</p>
<p>For this reason, learning a little bit of Python was great but re-affirmed the need to eventually learn some statically typed language such as C# to understand the ‘other side’ of computing where there is a lot more done up front by the developer to prevent performance issues that make up the bigger web applications of today.</p>
<p>It still seems there is some truth to the idea that if things are easier there is usually some drawback somewhere for some purpose. But that is pretty vague too and shouldn’t let you get in the way of using the fun and easier tool if its appropriate! </p>
<p>Anyways, a good introduction to Python!</p>

<hr>
<p>#####<strong>A quick recap</strong><br>In case I haven’t told you already… </p>
<p><img src="http://legolas.nz/sites/default/files/sketch-crest.png" alt="Our humorous parody crest"></p>
<p>It was great to read about the <a href="https://www.govhack.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">2016 GovHack</a> going smoothly. Unfortunately it was not practicable for me to attend on US Eastern time but not for a lack of trying! (‘16 hours behind’ is pretty off the beat!). <a href="https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/dunedin-website-team-wins-nationwide-competition" target="_blank" rel="external">In 2015 I was proud to be part of a team that won the first national spirit of GovHack award. We were also representing New Zealand in Australia in the first GovHack Awards where the official competition included New Zealand.</a></p>
<p>Like anything else you could make in 46 hours, our project result from 2015 is still a humble looking project. However, it achieved an important proof-of-concept: a first initial set of features that received a warm response from the community and recognition of the Judges of Govhack 2015.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything you see at legolas.nz was made in 46 hours, maybe with a few typos fixed later. Our project video was made with freemium software that retains an audio watermark in the background. Its all kinda naff like most hacked together things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was accomplished with special credit to <a href="https://github.com/xurizaemon" target="_blank" rel="external">Chris Burgess</a> who used the .XML dataset with no access to a corresponding .XSLT stylesheet at the time and still produced what you see at <a href="">legolas.nz</a>. That is, the entire set of legislation from 2015 displayed in a (roughly) visually similar appearance with the ability for inline comments, styled using some basic reverse engineering. This set of legislation is searchable and commentable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That this is even possible is pretty special when you consider the pace of change in this area[^1]:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>1267 AD - <a href="http://legislation.govt.nz/subscribe/act/imperial/1267/0023/1.0" target="_blank" rel="external">Statute of Marlborough c.23</a></strong><br>The oldest piece of statute law not repealed in the UK. Still contained within the NZ Imperial statute books still and in the <a href="http://legislation.govt.nz/subscribe/act/imperial/1267/0023/1.0/096be8ed8009afe5.xml" target="_blank" rel="external">XML Dataset</a>.</li>
<li><strong>2002 AD - <a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-zealand-legislation-goes-line" target="_blank" rel="external">New Zealand Legislation goes online</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>2015 AD - <a href="https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2014-ps71" target="_blank" rel="external">New Zealand Legislation in PDF gains official version status</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>2016 AD - <a href="https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2015-ps7126" target="_blank" rel="external">New Zealand Legislation in HTML gains official version status</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Why-is-HTML-becoming-an-official-version-significant"><a href="#Why-is-HTML-becoming-an-official-version-significant" class="headerlink" title="Why is HTML becoming an official version significant?"></a>Why is HTML becoming an <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2012/0119/latest/DLM2998516.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_legislation+2012_resel_25_a&amp;p=1" target="_blank" rel="external">official version</a> significant?</h4><p><br></p>
<p>I imagine there must have been some reasons for the PCO to make the change in the first place. For those wanting concrete examples:</p>
<h5 id="At-Court"><a href="#At-Court" class="headerlink" title="At Court"></a>At Court</h5><blockquote>
<p>In a courtroom, a lawyer could use a device such as an tablet or laptop to display the official HTML or PDF version from the NZ Legislation website and this would be recognized as displaying an official source of legislation (by legislation). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might seem trivial but it could save some weight of carrying redundant copies of legislation. Maybe a lawyer forgot something and the digital official version is a handy substitute. Many lawyers can’t do this in other places.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a courtroom, a self-represented party in a case could cite legislation that they discovered by googling on their device before or during the case. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which I think is good. More time for discussing relevance, less time on the officiousness around materials being presented. Someone insisting on self-representing is facing an uphill battle as-is. People are going to be an ‘internet lawyer’ despite all warnings not to and we can really only hope to increase the quality of what they access. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/gacode/Default.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">Lawyers or Pro Se in another jurisdictions for example would have to cite only from a printed official annotated code from that jurisdiction that costs several hundred dollars.</a></p>
<h5 id="Digital-futures"><a href="#Digital-futures" class="headerlink" title="Digital futures"></a>Digital futures</h5><p>Much less concrete but more exciting has been our groups discussions on what things like this could mean for the future of legislation and ways people interact with it.</p>
<h2 id="Meeting"><a href="#Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Meeting"></a><strong>Meeting</strong></h2><p>The award from Govhack 2015 and attending the wonderful GovHack Red Carpet awards at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney left us with a lot questions and excitement. This is another way of saying, development stopped for the time being. We knew we had to talk to the PCO before we invested more time before and making any false start either, given our experience not having the stylesheet.</p>
<p>We recently conferenced with two staff of the PCO, Richard Wallace and Michelle Groves. Both had great information and some directing questions for our project. We appreciate their time and the PCO had some good directive our project needed a better scope. We were also reminded of the specific neutral role of the PCO and limitations on help the PCO could provide.</p>
<p>Scope is key for any software. <em>My stab at a definition is:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>a free and open source software project to enable independent annotation, visualization and data science on the datasets of New Zealand legislative instruments <strong><small>with the requirement of preserving the integrity of the underlying legislative instrument and/or its official legal status within New Zealand</small></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think that such a project could help enable a whole variety of other projects in the public interest and generally increase readership and engagement with legislative sources in their best data forms. Consder it “Ctrl-f” rather than “Our political solution: manifesto V1.0”. Think more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth" target="_blank" rel="external">“Single Source of Truth”</a> rather than something more literal in a political sphere. I imagine it would easily be able to be forked for other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In our particular concept we used the example of inline comments, but that was just one potential application, with other loose ideas floated as user stories to consider further.</p>
<p>We believe alongside this technical scope that tools meeting the purpose we describe above could help improve the quality of debate in our democracy. This is our opinion, and we shared some thoughts about this in our GovHack project, but they are not ipso facto what we set out to accomplish.</p>
<p>I don’t think it is splitting hairs to say we may have our own personal political opinions but wish to work on a tool that could be usable by someone of a different opinion. I think it is motivating and would hope to prove something by making a good tool. </p>
<p>The above reasons are why I think it could be a good collaborative open-source project. There are some notable ones where different ‘interests’ such as the <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jupyter Project</a> which combines elements of finance and science, the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tor Project</a> which combines NGO and Human Rights support as well as support by various Governmental bodies such as US Federal Agencies.</p>
<p>We certainly don’t expect superior access to data over anyone else. What we want, with some co-operation, is a “better API” for interfacing with the PCO. <a href="https://www.dto.gov.au/blog/hacking-for-better-government-services/" target="_blank" rel="external">That governance needs a better API is a little bit of a rallying call from GovHack.</a></p>
<h2 id="Future"><a href="#Future" class="headerlink" title="Future"></a><strong>Future</strong></h2><p>I suggested in the conference that there are particular features to New Zealand legislation that make it appropriate to develop such particular tools. Development since the weekend so far has been in the form of planning and discussion, also engaging with materials such as the New Zealand Law Style Guide and developments in legislation.</p>
<p>So what do I mean? First, we should assess what the status quo is. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_5" target="_blank" rel="external">Credit where credit is due: NZ is ahead of the curve on this particular issue and in general</a>. Which is great.</p>
<h6 id="Technical"><a href="#Technical" class="headerlink" title="Technical"></a>Technical</h6><p><img src="http://www.lawfoundation.org.nz/style-guide/images/nzlsg_cover.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://data.govt.nz/dataset/show/776" target="_blank" rel="external">XML Dataset details from the PCO were posted  </a>as part of GovHack to give access to the online file structure. </p>
<p>These directories are public but this information about the file structure allows for greater ease finding and copying material. This is one kind of API- giving practical details of how to interact with a dataset.</p>
<p>One issue though is that usually a stylesheet in XSLT format to render the XML into the HTML legislation you see on the website, unless the PCO uses some specific XML conversion software that does not require it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A snippet of NZ legislation dataset in .XML:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">&lt;?xml version=&apos;1.0&apos; encoding=&apos;UTF-8&apos;?&gt;</div><div class="line">&lt;act date.assent=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;DLM10900&quot; in.amend=&quot;false&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en-NZ&quot; irdnumbering=&quot;no&quot; act.no=&quot;23&quot; act.type=&quot;imperial&quot; date.as.at=&quot;2007-09-03&quot; date.first.valid=&quot;2007-09-18&quot; stage=&quot;reprint&quot; year=&quot;1267&quot;&gt;&lt;cover id=&quot;DLM10901&quot;&gt;&lt;title xml:lang=&quot;en-NZ&quot;&gt;Statute of Marlborough 1267&lt;/title&gt;&lt;cover.reprint-note&gt;&lt;para xml:lang=&quot;en-NZ&quot;&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;admin-office&gt;Source: New Zealand Parliamentary Library, International Documents Collection&lt;/admin-office&gt;&lt;/cover.reprint-note&gt;&lt;/cover&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also some technical matters such as the semantic labelling of HTML elements in NZ Legislation that are not obvious with internal documentation.</p>
<p>We have had some initial communication following the meeting, suggesting to use the minified CSS with the HTML, but we are planning to follow up with more queries about the formatting from .XML as it will likely be the best way to rendering HTML pages on our own platform.</p>
<p>PDF’s are by nature just a set of digital images layered onto each other. Its exactly for the reason they are great for other things they are awful for our purposes. PDF’s are great if you do not want to accidentally ruin the formatting of/edit. PDF’s are unsuitable for this project, which calls for a degree of flexibility and ability to edit to separate concerns of the software applying onto the legislation. </p>
<hr>
<p>… and there is an update. Some 1400 words. But hey, our Democracy and its laws are interesting enough. Lets keep this conversation going ^_^.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.airbridge.ac.nz/2016/08/01/my-schedule-for-the-next-few-months/" target="_blank" rel="external">As my schedule dictates</a> I plan to begin personally committing (or making ‘pull requests’ more like) to try and parse out the text for re-use. </p>

        <p>The traffic in this city can be awful during the day but riding down some of its main streets in clear traffic, as I did tonight, can send shivers down your spine. </p>
<p>You can see in areas where the road follows the Eastern Continental Divide, and with an active imagination you feel like you are riding up the spine of the southeast, with rainfall one side of the road going to the Atlantic, the other side into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Riding along and over the ridges of many small hills upwards gives a variety of views, but almost always there is a solid, horizon formed by the treeline.</p>
<p><strong>Major streets include:</strong></p>
<p>Peachtree Road/Street</p>
<ul>
<li>“Main Street”</li>
<li>Crosses the area of approximately highest elevation in Atlanta around the aptly named High Museum of Art</li>
</ul>
<p>Ponce De Leon Ave</p>
<ul>
<li>Irregular and winding eastern corridor following closely to the Eastern Continental Divide, host to numerous cultural sights of importance. It also bears the historical marks of segregation, as roads crossing Ponce De Leon often change names representing historical racial/religious divides in neighborhoods.</li>
</ul>
<p>10th Avenue</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugs the south end of Piedmont Park - Atlanta’s finest green space - and is home to the cities first dedicated cycle highway.One of a number of key arterial roads in a grid that cut across major highways.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spring St </p>
<ul>
<li>On one side of you are 10+ lanes of Interstate Highway. On the other is Midtown. This important junction road also attracts terrible driving habits as people are hectic to get in the right lane at the last minute.</li>
