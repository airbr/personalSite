Unfortunately it was not practicable for me to attend on US Eastern time but not for a lack of trying! ('16 hours behind' is pretty off the beat!). [In 2015 I was proud to be part of a team that won the first national spirit of GovHack award. We were also representing New Zealand in Australia in the first GovHack Awards where the official competition included New Zealand.](https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/dunedin-website-team-wins-nationwide-competition)\n\nLike anything else you could make in 46 hours, our project result from 2015 is still a humble looking project. However, it achieved an important proof-of-concept: a first initial set of features that received a warm response from the community and recognition of the Judges of Govhack 2015.\n\n> Everything you see at legolas.nz was made in 46 hours, maybe with a few typos fixed later. Our project video was made with freemium software that retains an audio watermark in the background. Its all kinda naff like most hacked together things.\n\nThis was accomplished with special credit to [Chris Burgess](https://github.com/xurizaemon) who used the .XML dataset with no access to a corresponding .XSLT stylesheet at the time and still produced what you see at [legolas.nz](). That is, the entire set of legislation from 2015 displayed in a (roughly) visually similar appearance with the ability for inline comments, styled using some basic reverse engineering. This set of legislation is searchable and commentable.\n\n>That this is even possible is pretty special when you consider the pace of change in this area[^1]:\n\n* **1267 AD - [Statute of Marlborough c.23](http://legislation.govt.nz/subscribe/act/imperial/1267/0023/1.0)**\nThe oldest piece of statute law not repealed in the UK. Still contained within the NZ Imperial statute books still and in the [XML Dataset](http://legislation.govt.nz/subscribe/act/imperial/1267/0023/1.0/096be8ed8009afe5.xml).\n* **2002 AD - [New Zealand Legislation goes online](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-zealand-legislation-goes-line)**\n* **2015 AD - [New Zealand Legislation in PDF gains official version status](https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2014-ps71)**\n* **2016 AD - [New Zealand Legislation in HTML gains official version status](https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2015-ps7126)**\n\n#### Why is HTML becoming an [official version](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2012/0119/latest/DLM2998516.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_legislation+2012_resel_25_a&p=1) significant?\n<br>\n\nI imagine there must have been some reasons for the PCO to make the change in the first place. For those wanting concrete examples:\n\n##### At Court\n\n> In a courtroom, a lawyer could use a device such as an tablet or laptop to display the official HTML or PDF version from the NZ Legislation website and this would be recognized as displaying an official source of legislation (by legislation). \n\nIt might seem trivial but it could save some weight of carrying redundant copies of legislation. Maybe a lawyer forgot something and the digital official version is a handy substitute.

Unfortunately it was not practicable for me to attend on US Eastern time but not for a lack of trying! (‘16 hours behind’ is pretty off the beat!). <a href=\"https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/dunedin-website-team-wins-nationwide-competition\">In 2015 I was proud to be part of a team that won the first national spirit of GovHack award. We were also representing New Zealand in Australia in the first GovHack Awards where the official competition included New Zealand.</a></p>\n<p>Like anything else you could make in 46 hours, our project result from 2015 is still a humble looking project. However, it achieved an important proof-of-concept: a first initial set of features that received a warm response from the community and recognition of the Judges of Govhack 2015.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything you see at legolas.nz was made in 46 hours, maybe with a few typos fixed later. Our project video was made with freemium software that retains an audio watermark in the background. Its all kinda naff like most hacked together things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was accomplished with special credit to <a href=\"https://github.com/xurizaemon\">Chris Burgess</a> who used the .XML dataset with no access to a corresponding .XSLT stylesheet at the time and still produced what you see at <a href=\"\">legolas.nz</a>. That is, the entire set of legislation from 2015 displayed in a (roughly) visually similar appearance with the ability for inline comments, styled using some basic reverse engineering. This set of legislation is searchable and commentable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That this is even possible is pretty special when you consider the pace of change in this area[^1]:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1267 AD - <a href=\"http://legislation.govt.nz/subscribe/act/imperial/1267/0023/1.0\">Statute of Marlborough c.23</a></strong><br>The oldest piece of statute law not repealed in the UK. Still contained within the NZ Imperial statute books still and in the <a href=\"http://legislation.govt.nz/subscribe/act/imperial/1267/0023/1.0/096be8ed8009afe5.xml\">XML Dataset</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>2002 AD - <a href=\"https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-zealand-legislation-goes-line\">New Zealand Legislation goes online</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>2015 AD - <a href=\"https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2014-ps71\">New Zealand Legislation in PDF gains official version status</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>2016 AD - <a href=\"https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2015-ps7126\">New Zealand Legislation in HTML gains official version status</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"Why-is-HTML-becoming-an-official-version-significant\"><a href=\"#Why-is-HTML-becoming-an-official-version-significant\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Why is HTML becoming an official version significant?\"></a>Why is HTML becoming an <a href=\"http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2012/0119/latest/DLM2998516.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_legislation+2012_resel_25_a&amp;p=1\">official version</a> significant?</h4><p><br></p>\n<p>I imagine there must have been some reasons for the PCO to make the change in the first place. For those wanting concrete examples:</p>\n<h5 id=\"At-Court\"><a href=\"#At-Court\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"At Court\"></a>At Court</h5><blockquote>\n<p>In a courtroom, a lawyer could use a device such as an tablet or laptop to display the official HTML or PDF version from the NZ Legislation website and this would be recognized as displaying an official source of legislation (by legislation). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It might seem trivial but it could save some weight of carrying redundant copies of legislation. Maybe a lawyer forgot something and the digital official version is a handy substitute. Many lawyers can’t do this in other places.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a courtroom, a self-represented party in a case could cite legislation that they discovered by googling on their device before or during the case. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which I think is good. More time for discussing relevance, less time on the officiousness around materials being presented. Someone insisting on self-representing is facing an uphill battle as-is. People are going to be an ‘internet lawyer’ despite all warnings not to and we can really only hope to increase the quality of what they access. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/gacode/Default.asp\">Lawyers or Pro Se in another jurisdictions for example would have to cite only from a printed official annotated code from that jurisdiction that costs several hundred dollars.</a></p>\n<h5 id=\"Digital-futures\"><a href=\"#Digital-futures\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Digital futures\"></a>Digital futures</h5><p>Much less concrete but more exciting has been our groups discussions on what things like this could mean for the future of legislation and ways people interact with it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Meeting\"><a href=\"#Meeting\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Meeting\"></a><strong>Meeting</strong></h2><p>The award from Govhack 2015 and attending the wonderful GovHack Red Carpet awards at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney left us with a lot questions and excitement. This is another way of saying, development stopped for the time being. We knew we had to talk to the PCO before we invested more time before and making any false start either, given our experience not having the stylesheet.</p>\n<p>We recently conferenced with two staff of the PCO, Richard Wallace and Michelle Groves. Both had great information and some directing questions for our project. We appreciate their time and the PCO had some good directive our project needed a better scope. We were also reminded of the specific neutral role of the PCO and limitations on help the PCO could provide.</p>\n<p>Scope is key for any software. <em>My stab at a definition is:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a free and open source software project to enable independent annotation, visualization and data science on the datasets of New Zealand legislative instruments <strong><small>with the requirement of preserving the integrity of the underlying legislative instrument and/or its official legal status within New Zealand</small></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We think that such a project could help enable a whole variety of other projects in the public interest and generally increase readership and engagement with legislative sources in their best data forms. Consder it “Ctrl-f” rather than “Our political solution: manifesto V1.0”. Think more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth\">“Single Source of Truth”</a> rather than something more literal in a political sphere. I imagine it would easily be able to be forked for other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>In our particular concept we used the example of inline comments, but that was just one potential application, with other loose ideas floated as user stories to consider further.</p>\n<p>We believe alongside this technical scope that tools meeting the purpose we describe above could help improve the quality of debate in our democracy. This is our opinion, and we shared some thoughts about this in our GovHack project, but they are not ipso facto what we set out to accomplish.</p>\n<p>I don’t think it is splitting hairs to say we may have our own personal political opinions but wish to work on a tool that could be usable by someone of a different opinion. I think it is motivating and would hope to prove something by making a good tool. </p>\n<p>The above reasons are why I think it could be a good collaborative open-source project. There are some notable ones where different ‘interests’ such as the <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter Project</a> which combines elements of finance and science, the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor Project</a> which combines NGO and Human Rights support as well as support by various Governmental bodies such as US Federal Agencies.</p>\n<p>We certainly don’t expect superior access to data over anyone else. What we want, with some co-operation, is a “better API” for interfacing with the PCO. <a href=\"https://www.dto.gov.au/blog/hacking-for-better-government-services/\">That governance needs a better API is a little bit of a rallying call from GovHack.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"Future\"><a href=\"#Future\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Future\"></a><strong>Future</strong></h2><p>I suggested in the conference that there are particular features to New Zealand legislation that make it appropriate to develop such particular tools. Development since the weekend so far has been in the form of planning and discussion, also engaging with materials such as the New Zealand Law Style Guide and developments in legislation.</p>\n<p>So what do I mean? First, we should assess what the status quo is. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_5\">Credit where credit is due: NZ is ahead of the curve on this particular issue and in general</a>. Which is great.</p>\n<h6 id=\"Technical\"><a href=\"#Technical\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Technical\"></a>Technical</h6><p><img src=\"http://www.lawfoundation.org.nz/style-guide/images/nzlsg_cover.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://data.govt.nz/dataset/show/776\">XML Dataset details from the PCO were posted  </a>as part of GovHack to give access to the online file structure. </p>\n<p>These directories are public but this information about the file structure allows for greater ease finding and copying material.

As a current full-time student part of our tuition is effectively in-house credit for the [pretty wide range of workshops/events GA hosts](https://generalassemb.ly/education?).\n\nI decided to attend for two reasons:\n\n\n* Python is not taught in the Immersive Web Development curriculum\n\n* I knew Python has wide usage in particular fields and is a common 'first language' learned \n\n  * Python is used by students in the Data Immersive program at General Assembly and I had conversations with some of them about their experiences with Python. My prior exposure to it was mainly from my peers at Otago University who were studying science. Research scientists are a large user group of python.\n\n\nWalking into this bootcamp there were a number of positive/negative ideas which had been shared to me and I wasn't really informed enough to have an opinion on:\n\n* That Python was elegant and easier than other languages (indeed to the point it could spoil you against learning harder languages)\n\n* That Python was slow and 'bloated' and the reason for its adoption is really just the ease of use that overrides most performance concerns\n\n * However, there is a related argument/point that in fields such as data science and analytics human resources such as developer time are more scarce than processing power. Hence, sometimes it would be better to have a 'slow program' that produces the right result than one that requires more intensive developer time. This point was explicitly made by the instructor as a rationale for using Python despite its performance issues.\n\n**Format of the bootcamp:**\n\nThe Bootcamp went from 10-4pm with a lunch break. It was taught at a fast pace but with opportunities to catch up as the instructor took time to move around the room to help fix any bugs/installation errors. It was assuring to hear the instructor state getting the development environment set up properly is always the biggest challenge in a classroom environment for coding.\n\nTo fix part of this problem we used a cloud-based deployment using [C9](www.c9.io) of a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook to view the Python based course materials. This was to enable the python code in the notebook to be run by computers in the cloud and not be reliant on local internet signal quality. \n\nNice little starter command:\n\n``jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --no-browser``\n\n**Cliff notes:**\n\n* I really liked [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). I can see its immediate value in being able to visualize data and 'show your work' with chunks of code leading into that visualization on the same page.\n\n* After the first hour of setting up software and the cloud dev environment we got pretty much straight into it with the basics. A copy of my very first Python code/hello world::\n\n```\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> print 'Hello World!!'\nHello World!!\n>>> 2+2\n4\n>>>\n```\n* We went through major features and aspects of Python vis-a-vis other languages and its quirks. Some interesting ones were:\n *  Python is dynamically typed language, meaning it executes many things on runtime rather than could be executed during compilation. This can cause various side effects and errors. As one resource put it \"if a program is statically typed, you know that certain types of errors are not possible\".\n * Python has a large version split between user bases of 2.7 and 3.x , and that 2.7 requires a floating point in division is one of the first 'gotchas' associated with Python:\n\n**A 'Gotcha':**\n--\n\n**In Python 2.7 you may need to add a floating point for numbers to get have decimal usage or else you get some crazy errors/bugs.... this is 'fixed in Python 3.x:**\n\n**3/2 in Python 2.7:**\n```\nx = 3\ny = 2\nprint(x/y)\n...\nOut: 1\n```\nWha?\n\n**3/2 in Python 3.x:**\n```\nx = 3\ny = 2\nprint(x/y)\n...\nOut: 1.5\n```\n**To get the more correct 3/2 in Python 2.7...**\n```\nx = 3\ny = 2\nprint(x*1.0/y)\n...\nOut: 1.5 \n```\nI can see how some of these apparently tiny but fundamental changes could make things break...\n\nIn the class we touched on a lot in the class including usage of type, control flow, modules. Hard to cover it all here.\n\n**Pretty visualization from near the end of class using Pandas:**\n![Python Visualization using Pandas](https://i.imgur.com/n1exROn.png)\n\n\nFeatures of Python code\n--\n\n**Elegance - Consider the Python For Loop compared to [vanilla Javascript:](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp)**\n\n>This:\n```\n# Measure some strings:\nwords = ['foo', 'window', 'bar', 'hugewordlengthtester', 'hugewordlengthtesterhugewordlengthtester']\nfor w in words:\n    print w, len(w)\n    \nwords_length = [len(w) for w in words]\n```\nnb '# ' is the syntax for comments in Python\n>Outputs this:\n\n```\nfoo 3\nwindow 6\nbar 3\nhugewordlengthtester 20\nhugewordlengthtesterhugewordlengthtester 40\n```\nI barely need to tell _anyone_ who has been anywhere near a [Javascript For Loop](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp) that this is a much more elegant and simple code for this function.

As a current full-time student part of our tuition is effectively in-house credit for the [pretty wide range of workshops/events GA hosts](https://generalassemb.ly/education?).\n\nI decided to attend for two reasons:\n\n\n* Python is not taught in the Immersive Web Development curriculum\n\n* I knew Python has wide usage in particular fields and is a common 'first language' learned \n\n  * Python is used by students in the Data Immersive program at General Assembly and I had conversations with some of them about their experiences with Python. My prior exposure to it was mainly from my peers at Otago University who were studying science. Research scientists are a large user group of python.\n\n\nWalking into this bootcamp there were a number of positive/negative ideas which had been shared to me and I wasn't really informed enough to have an opinion on:\n\n* That Python was elegant and easier than other languages (indeed to the point it could spoil you against learning harder languages)\n\n* That Python was slow and 'bloated' and the reason for its adoption is really just the ease of use that overrides most performance concerns\n\n * However, there is a related argument/point that in fields such as data science and analytics human resources such as developer time are more scarce than processing power. Hence, sometimes it would be better to have a 'slow program' that produces the right result than one that requires more intensive developer time. This point was explicitly made by the instructor as a rationale for using Python despite its performance issues.\n\n**Format of the bootcamp:**\n\nThe Bootcamp went from 10-4pm with a lunch break. It was taught at a fast pace but with opportunities to catch up as the instructor took time to move around the room to help fix any bugs/installation errors. It was assuring to hear the instructor state getting the development environment set up properly is always the biggest challenge in a classroom environment for coding.\n\nTo fix part of this problem we used a cloud-based deployment using [C9](www.c9.io) of a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook to view the Python based course materials. This was to enable the python code in the notebook to be run by computers in the cloud and not be reliant on local internet signal quality. \n\nNice little starter command:\n\n``jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --no-browser``\n\n**Cliff notes:**\n\n* I really liked [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). I can see its immediate value in being able to visualize data and 'show your work' with chunks of code leading into that visualization on the same page.\n\n* After the first hour of setting up software and the cloud dev environment we got pretty much straight into it with the basics. A copy of my very first Python code/hello world::\n\n```\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> print 'Hello World!!'\nHello World!!\n>>> 2+2\n4\n>>>\n```\n* We went through major features and aspects of Python vis-a-vis other languages and its quirks. Some interesting ones were:\n *  Python is dynamically typed language, meaning it executes many things on runtime rather than could be executed during compilation. This can cause various side effects and errors. As one resource put it \"if a program is statically typed, you know that certain types of errors are not possible\".\n * Python has a large version split between user bases of 2.7 and 3.x , and that 2.7 requires a floating point in division is one of the first 'gotchas' associated with Python:\n\n**A 'Gotcha':**\n--\n\n**In Python 2.7 you may need to add a floating point for numbers to get have decimal usage or else you get some crazy errors/bugs.... this is 'fixed in Python 3.x:**\n\n**3/2 in Python 2.7:**\n```\nx = 3\ny = 2\nprint(x/y)\n...\nOut: 1\n```\nWha?\n\n**3/2 in Python 3.x:**\n```\nx = 3\ny = 2\nprint(x/y)\n...\nOut: 1.5\n```\n**To get the more correct 3/2 in Python 2.7...**\n```\nx = 3\ny = 2\nprint(x*1.0/y)\n...\nOut: 1.5 \n```\nI can see how some of these apparently tiny but fundamental changes could make things break...\n\nIn the class we touched on a lot in the class including usage of type, control flow, modules. Hard to cover it all here.\n\n**Pretty visualization from near the end of class using Pandas:**\n![Python Visualization using Pandas](https://i.imgur.com/n1exROn.png)\n\n\nFeatures of Python code\n--\n\n**Elegance - Consider the Python For Loop compared to [vanilla Javascript:](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp)**\n\n>This:\n```\n# Measure some strings:\nwords = ['foo', 'window', 'bar', 'hugewordlengthtester', 'hugewordlengthtesterhugewordlengthtester']\nfor w in words:\n    print w, len(w)\n    \nwords_length = [len(w) for w in words]\n```\nnb '# ' is the syntax for comments in Python\n>Outputs this:\n\n```\nfoo 3\nwindow 6\nbar 3\nhugewordlengthtester 20\nhugewordlengthtesterhugewordlengthtester 40\n```\nI barely need to tell _anyone_ who has been anywhere near a [Javascript For Loop](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp) that this is a much more elegant and simple code for this function. You can even get it down to 1-2 lines. Credit where credit is due.\n\n\n**Modules - i.e. Pandas for visualization we saw in class.**\n\nIn Python we learned that modules really are just blocks of python that will be 'pre-run' in your terminal, introducing variables and so forth.

You can produce powerful, high quality work- but it takes place within some boundaries.</p>\n<p>This workflow does not seem apply as well to a dynamic, live, web development environment where latency in general should not exceed three seconds. This challenge is heightened as some web applications should be able to meet the needs of potentially millions of users at an ‘enterprise’ level.</p>\n<p>For this reason, learning a little bit of Python was great but re-affirmed the need to eventually learn some statically typed language such as C# to understand the ‘other side’ of computing where there is a lot more done up front by the developer to prevent performance issues that make up the bigger web applications of today.</p>\n<p>It still seems there is some truth to the idea that if things are easier there is usually some drawback somewhere for some purpose.

I chose this course along with the [Python Bootcamp](https://www.airbridge.ac.nz/2016/08/28/1-day-python-bootcamp-recap/) as extra courses to take with my in-house credit with GA as a current WDI student. As a current student at GA looking for a new opportunity after graduating I am not really an independent observer of a GA course but will try to write something interesting!\n\nAs a summary:\n> I believe this class helped me understand more about the work done by UX professionals and how I could work with someone working in UX in a future development role. \n \n>Early on in the course we examined the dismissive stereotype that UX is really just visual design and how people feel about shiny exciting buttons (even as much as I like shiny and exciting buttons). \n\n> I would be lying if I hadn't thought like that about UX occasionally before. However, I have started to see the increasing importance and professional specialization in UX in recent years.\n\n**Background**\n\nI remembered [there was a conference in the city of Dunedin called UX Design day](https://twitter.com/uxdesignday) just before I left New Zealand which I was recommended to attend. I also became aware of a website called [Dark Patterns](http://darkpatterns.org/) that critically looks at unethical or exploitative applications of UX which actually I think really focused me to consider the potential power of the craft.\n\nWhile UX does seem to be an increasingly relevant discipline it was recognized it is still not widely understood/recognized for the variety of work skills involved:\n![](http://uxisnotui.com/downloads/with-title.png)\n\nI now know that UX is indeed bigger than shiny buttons on a UI. For one example, this course made consider the role and scope of [wireframes in development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe). In class in WDI we have typically created our own wireframes for our own APP idea's to meet project specification.\n\nIn the course I thought more about how in developing a real world app of any particularly big size quality information would be wanted from the target market to make the wireframes the best fit possible. A wireframe fed from information purely from developers given a description would likely be ignorant of the customers needs/wants and could lead to costly redesigns.\n\nConsidering the wider range of work and information gathering such as interviews and focus groups that might go into making and testing a wireframe reminded me of the much larger business context development takes place within.\n\n**Instruction**\n\nI appreciated being taught by a working professional who was involved in the community. [@Playfulpixel](https://twitter.com/playfulpixel)'s style is a practiced teaching style that is also deliberately informal. UX seems to have emerging best practices and methodologies but like many aspects of development it has few traditional 'constraints' such as licensing or respected certifications.\n\n**Importance of primary sources, less-rigorous secondary processing?**\n\nIn the class there was an emphasis on quality interviewing practices such as avoiding asking suggestive questions. These practices were stated to ultimately lower the quality of your UX work product which is itself a consideration of how users would experience some product. \n\nHowever, at the same time there was an emphasis on getting quality primary source information the standard changes quickly when you get to secondary stages of processing the information, where UX specific processes and ideas are applied. You might say it is more of an art made from science.\n\nOne questionable concept - which the instructor was convincingly critical of - are \"[Personas](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/)\" that are prone to not being validated correctly. Personas are apparently commonly used and considered useful as they can more easily 'interface' with the discipline of marketing.\n\nI can certainly see how concepts such as a 'corporeal' person or 'spirit consumer' or 'spirit animal' (maybe the product is for pets...) could take on a life of their own and not actually add much value to a UX process... as well as be open for lampooning.\n\n**Scope: Material on [Slideshare](slideshare.net/jacklynburgan)**\n\nOur class had to  work at pace to get through all of the material contained on by the end of the class which we did by skipping making a persona ourself. I can see that it would be difficult to plan content for a one day bootcamp and accurately depict how much work could go into an item of UX work which could span months or years and to study a potentially global market. \n\nI can also see how this course could seem \"breezy\" who doesn't see it against the bigger picture of UX. Elements of exercises such as using post-it notes to record points that come up from interviews could seem cheesy and relaxed as opposed to something more \"hard\" or \"technical\" like coding or measuring metrics from digital based user interviews/tests. \n\nHowever, I can see this attitude misses the point that significant and valuable information is still derived from potential customers who have conflicting and sometimes irrational concerns and thoughts. A relaxed and cheesy environment arguably allows a focus on similar drives for food, drink, the restroom and to sleep among the many other lower common denominators that ultimately guide many of our experiences and purchasing decisions. UX seems to seek to really capture that value.\n\nThe instructor pointed out in some jobs the work that goes into UX projects including empathy maps, personas and wireframes can take months and years. That various businesses seem to consider these processes valuable enough to justify such investment could also seem to speak for itself.\n\n##### Groceries....\n\nGrocery shopping was chosen as an example of a more common denominator example applicable for a 'all-comers' classroom setting to try some UX Design for the bootcamp. My result wireframed an app based around notes from interviews the class conducted:\n\n![](/content/images/2016/09/cards.png)\n\nThe 'insights' I took from notes following interviews conducted by our tables were very roughly:\n\n* Everyone has a level of frustration with grocery shopping (including traffic, parking, putting shopping carts away, lack of shopping carts, selection).\n* Majority of people still prefer in-store shopping for various reasons than moving to online grocery delivery\n* Consumers tend to be loyal to stores for a variety of reasons but do not seem to take much concern about particular loyalty schemes such as coupons or cards\n\nMy wireframe attempts to depict a \"Shopping List 2.0\" aimed at this type of user that still grocery shops in-store with loyalty to a particular store. This app will intend to reduce the frustration felt by this user by making planning a shopping trip more enjoyable to enhance this store-loyalty.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/09/cartwireframe.jpg)\n\n\nThe wireframed app includes:\n\n* Dynamic shopping cart animations when items are added by swiping grocery items down from a scrolling drop-down menu using material design principles\n* Minimum three dynamically updated elements including:\n * A price sub total for items put into the cart\n * An indicator as to the actual size and weight of the basket of items\n * An updated 'loyalty' counter indicating the current and potential loyalty savings if this order of items is purchased.\n\nThe rationale behind this app is that it to an extent aims to glamorize (or gamify) the simple task of making a shopping list that in-store shoppers typically rely on. It allows the user to get more dynamically updated information in the process with live prices from the store (lets keep this hypothetical heh... my development knowledge is enough now I know this isn't so easy as it sounds).\n\nI envision potential for targeted loyalty scheme offers via the app, redeemable in person, but only triggered by certain targeted conditions such as composition of the shopping cart or location of the user.\n\n**Very Junior Developer thoughts:**\n\nOn a first gut through, I would consider a lot of what I am describing above being very possible with Angular JS and access to a clean, easy to use API of grocery store data. Nothing stands out as infeasible.\n\nThe idea of a digitized, updated 'shopping list meets shopping cart' but that does not handle online orders or credit cards or other things makes things a whole lot simpler.\n\nI would consider [Materialize CSS](www.materializecss.com) or another material design based framework to the buttons and elements of the page to give a punch and pull feel to the animation of items being added and removed from the shopping cart.\n\n\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\n9/10 Good one day course, made me think/has some good general takeways, was still a little bit rushed\n\n[Link to copy of slides presented at Bootcamp](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5jpk-DPeLWvWUZuM2hzUVRTT2c/view?usp=sharing)","source":"_posts/UX-Design-Bootcamp-blog.md","raw":"---\ntitle: UX Design Bootcamp blog\ntags:\n\n  - Beau\n  - Morgan\n  - Murrah\n  - WDI\n  - Coding\n  - UX\n  - UI\n  - Wireframe\n  - Developer\n  - Design\n  - Development\n  - Shopping Cart\n  - General Assembly\n  - Review\npermalink: ux-design-bootcamp-general-assembly-review-morgan-murrah\nid: 39\nupdated: '2016-09-12 23:15:59'\ndate: 2016-09-10 17:04:32\n---\n\nRecap of UX Design Bootcamp at General Assembly instructed by [Jacklyn Cohen == @PlayfulPixel](https://twitter.com/@playfulpixel)\n\n![Hello](https://ga-core.s3.amazonaws.com/production/uploads/program/default_image/922/thumb_Building-your-team.jpg)\n\nOn September 10th I attended a one-day [User Experience Design Bootcamp](https://generalassemb.ly/education/user-experience-design-bootcamp) at the [General Assembly campus in Atlanta](https://generalassemb.ly/education?where=atlanta).

I chose this course along with the <a href=\"https://www.airbridge.ac.nz/2016/08/28/1-day-python-bootcamp-recap/\">Python Bootcamp</a> as extra courses to take with my in-house credit with GA as a current WDI student. As a current student at GA looking for a new opportunity after graduating I am not really an independent observer of a GA course but will try to write something interesting!</p>\n<p>As a summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe this class helped me understand more about the work done by UX professionals and how I could work with someone working in UX in a future development role. </p>\n<p>Early on in the course we examined the dismissive stereotype that UX is really just visual design and how people feel about shiny exciting buttons (even as much as I like shiny and exciting buttons). </p>\n<p>I would be lying if I hadn’t thought like that about UX occasionally before. However, I have started to see the increasing importance and professional specialization in UX in recent years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>I remembered <a href=\"https://twitter.com/uxdesignday\">there was a conference in the city of Dunedin called UX Design day</a> just before I left New Zealand which I was recommended to attend. I also became aware of a website called <a href=\"http://darkpatterns.org/\">Dark Patterns</a> that critically looks at unethical or exploitative applications of UX which actually I think really focused me to consider the potential power of the craft.</p>\n<p>While UX does seem to be an increasingly relevant discipline it was recognized it is still not widely understood/recognized for the variety of work skills involved:<br><img src=\"http://uxisnotui.com/downloads/with-title.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I now know that UX is indeed bigger than shiny buttons on a UI. For one example, this course made consider the role and scope of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe\">wireframes in development</a>. In class in WDI we have typically created our own wireframes for our own APP idea’s to meet project specification.</p>\n<p>In the course I thought more about how in developing a real world app of any particularly big size quality information would be wanted from the target market to make the wireframes the best fit possible. A wireframe fed from information purely from developers given a description would likely be ignorant of the customers needs/wants and could lead to costly redesigns.</p>\n<p>Considering the wider range of work and information gathering such as interviews and focus groups that might go into making and testing a wireframe reminded me of the much larger business context development takes place within.</p>\n<p><strong>Instruction</strong></p>\n<p>I appreciated being taught by a working professional who was involved in the community. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/playfulpixel\">@Playfulpixel</a>‘s style is a practiced teaching style that is also deliberately informal. UX seems to have emerging best practices and methodologies but like many aspects of development it has few traditional ‘constraints’ such as licensing or respected certifications.</p>\n<p><strong>Importance of primary sources, less-rigorous secondary processing?</strong></p>\n<p>In the class there was an emphasis on quality interviewing practices such as avoiding asking suggestive questions. These practices were stated to ultimately lower the quality of your UX work product which is itself a consideration of how users would experience some product. </p>\n<p>However, at the same time there was an emphasis on getting quality primary source information the standard changes quickly when you get to secondary stages of processing the information, where UX specific processes and ideas are applied. You might say it is more of an art made from science.</p>\n<p>One questionable concept - which the instructor was convincingly critical of - are “<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/\">Personas</a>“ that are prone to not being validated correctly. Personas are apparently commonly used and considered useful as they can more easily ‘interface’ with the discipline of marketing.</p>\n<p>I can certainly see how concepts such as a ‘corporeal’ person or ‘spirit consumer’ or ‘spirit animal’ (maybe the product is for pets…) could take on a life of their own and not actually add much value to a UX process… as well as be open for lampooning.</p>\n<p><strong>Scope: Material on <a href=\"slideshare.net/jacklynburgan\">Slideshare</a></strong></p>\n<p>Our class had to  work at pace to get through all of the material contained on by the end of the class which we did by skipping making a persona ourself. I can see that it would be difficult to plan content for a one day bootcamp and accurately depict how much work could go into an item of UX work which could span months or years and to study a potentially global market. </p>\n<p>I can also see how this course could seem “breezy” who doesn’t see it against the bigger picture of UX.
