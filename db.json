I chose this course along with the [Python Bootcamp](https://www.airbridge.ac.nz/2016/08/28/1-day-python-bootcamp-recap/) as extra courses to take with my in-house credit with GA as a current WDI student. As a current student at GA looking for a new opportunity after graduating I am not really an independent observer of a GA course but will try to write something interesting!\n\nAs a summary:\n> I believe this class helped me understand more about the work done by UX professionals and how I could work with someone working in UX in a future development role. \n \n>Early on in the course we examined the dismissive stereotype that UX is really just visual design and how people feel about shiny exciting buttons (even as much as I like shiny and exciting buttons). \n\n> I would be lying if I hadn't thought like that about UX occasionally before. However, I have started to see the increasing importance and professional specialization in UX in recent years.\n\n**Background**\n\nI remembered [there was a conference in the city of Dunedin called UX Design day](https://twitter.com/uxdesignday) just before I left New Zealand which I was recommended to attend. I also became aware of a website called [Dark Patterns](http://darkpatterns.org/) that critically looks at unethical or exploitative applications of UX which actually I think really focused me to consider the potential power of the craft.\n\nWhile UX does seem to be an increasingly relevant discipline it was recognized it is still not widely understood/recognized for the variety of work skills involved:\n![](http://uxisnotui.com/downloads/with-title.png)\n\nI now know that UX is indeed bigger than shiny buttons on a UI. For one example, this course made consider the role and scope of [wireframes in development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe). In class in WDI we have typically created our own wireframes for our own APP idea's to meet project specification.\n\nIn the course I thought more about how in developing a real world app of any particularly big size quality information would be wanted from the target market to make the wireframes the best fit possible. A wireframe fed from information purely from developers given a description would likely be ignorant of the customers needs/wants and could lead to costly redesigns.\n\nConsidering the wider range of work and information gathering such as interviews and focus groups that might go into making and testing a wireframe reminded me of the much larger business context development takes place within.\n\n**Instruction**\n\nI appreciated being taught by a working professional who was involved in the community. [@Playfulpixel](https://twitter.com/playfulpixel)'s style is a practiced teaching style that is also deliberately informal. UX seems to have emerging best practices and methodologies but like many aspects of development it has few traditional 'constraints' such as licensing or respected certifications.\n\n**Importance of primary sources, less-rigorous secondary processing?**\n\nIn the class there was an emphasis on quality interviewing practices such as avoiding asking suggestive questions. These practices were stated to ultimately lower the quality of your UX work product which is itself a consideration of how users would experience some product. \n\nHowever, at the same time there was an emphasis on getting quality primary source information the standard changes quickly when you get to secondary stages of processing the information, where UX specific processes and ideas are applied. You might say it is more of an art made from science.\n\nOne questionable concept - which the instructor was convincingly critical of - are \"[Personas](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/)\" that are prone to not being validated correctly. Personas are apparently commonly used and considered useful as they can more easily 'interface' with the discipline of marketing.\n\nI can certainly see how concepts such as a 'corporeal' person or 'spirit consumer' or 'spirit animal' (maybe the product is for pets...) could take on a life of their own and not actually add much value to a UX process... as well as be open for lampooning.\n\n**Scope: Material on [Slideshare](slideshare.net/jacklynburgan)**\n\nOur class had to  work at pace to get through all of the material contained on by the end of the class which we did by skipping making a persona ourself. I can see that it would be difficult to plan content for a one day bootcamp and accurately depict how much work could go into an item of UX work which could span months or years and to study a potentially global market. \n\nI can also see how this course could seem \"breezy\" who doesn't see it against the bigger picture of UX. Elements of exercises such as using post-it notes to record points that come up from interviews could seem cheesy and relaxed as opposed to something more \"hard\" or \"technical\" like coding or measuring metrics from digital based user interviews/tests. \n\nHowever, I can see this attitude misses the point that significant and valuable information is still derived from potential customers who have conflicting and sometimes irrational concerns and thoughts. A relaxed and cheesy environment arguably allows a focus on similar drives for food, drink, the restroom and to sleep among the many other lower common denominators that ultimately guide many of our experiences and purchasing decisions. UX seems to seek to really capture that value.\n\nThe instructor pointed out in some jobs the work that goes into UX projects including empathy maps, personas and wireframes can take months and years. That various businesses seem to consider these processes valuable enough to justify such investment could also seem to speak for itself.\n\n##### Groceries....\n\nGrocery shopping was chosen as an example of a more common denominator example applicable for a 'all-comers' classroom setting to try some UX Design for the bootcamp. My result wireframed an app based around notes from interviews the class conducted:\n\n![](/content/images/2016/09/cards.png)\n\nThe 'insights' I took from notes following interviews conducted by our tables were very roughly:\n\n* Everyone has a level of frustration with grocery shopping (including traffic, parking, putting shopping carts away, lack of shopping carts, selection).\n* Majority of people still prefer in-store shopping for various reasons than moving to online grocery delivery\n* Consumers tend to be loyal to stores for a variety of reasons but do not seem to take much concern about particular loyalty schemes such as coupons or cards\n\nMy wireframe attempts to depict a \"Shopping List 2.0\" aimed at this type of user that still grocery shops in-store with loyalty to a particular store. This app will intend to reduce the frustration felt by this user by making planning a shopping trip more enjoyable to enhance this store-loyalty.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/09/cartwireframe.jpg)\n\n\nThe wireframed app includes:\n\n* Dynamic shopping cart animations when items are added by swiping grocery items down from a scrolling drop-down menu using material design principles\n* Minimum three dynamically updated elements including:\n * A price sub total for items put into the cart\n * An indicator as to the actual size and weight of the basket of items\n * An updated 'loyalty' counter indicating the current and potential loyalty savings if this order of items is purchased.\n\nThe rationale behind this app is that it to an extent aims to glamorize (or gamify) the simple task of making a shopping list that in-store shoppers typically rely on. It allows the user to get more dynamically updated information in the process with live prices from the store (lets keep this hypothetical heh... my development knowledge is enough now I know this isn't so easy as it sounds).\n\nI envision potential for targeted loyalty scheme offers via the app, redeemable in person, but only triggered by certain targeted conditions such as composition of the shopping cart or location of the user.\n\n**Very Junior Developer thoughts:**\n\nOn a first gut through, I would consider a lot of what I am describing above being very possible with Angular JS and access to a clean, easy to use API of grocery store data. Nothing stands out as infeasible.\n\nThe idea of a digitized, updated 'shopping list meets shopping cart' but that does not handle online orders or credit cards or other things makes things a whole lot simpler.\n\nI would consider [Materialize CSS](www.materializecss.com) or another material design based framework to the buttons and elements of the page to give a punch and pull feel to the animation of items being added and removed from the shopping cart.\n\n\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\n9/10 Good one day course, made me think/has some good general takeways, was still a little bit rushed\n\n[Link to copy of slides presented at Bootcamp](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5jpk-DPeLWvWUZuM2hzUVRTT2c/view?usp=sharing)","source":"_posts/UX-Design-Bootcamp-blog.md","raw":"---\ntitle: UX Design Bootcamp blog\ntags:\n\n  - Beau\n  - Morgan\n  - Murrah\n  - WDI\n  - Coding\n  - UX\n  - UI\n  - Wireframe\n  - Developer\n  - Design\n  - Development\n  - Shopping Cart\n  - General Assembly\n  - Review\npermalink: ux-design-bootcamp-general-assembly-review-morgan-murrah\nid: 39\nupdated: '2016-09-12 23:15:59'\ndate: 2016-09-10 17:04:32\n---\n\nRecap of UX Design Bootcamp at General Assembly instructed by [Jacklyn Cohen == @PlayfulPixel](https://twitter.com/@playfulpixel)\n\n![Hello](https://ga-core.s3.amazonaws.com/production/uploads/program/default_image/922/thumb_Building-your-team.jpg)\n\nOn September 10th I attended a one-day [User Experience Design Bootcamp](https://generalassemb.ly/education/user-experience-design-bootcamp) at the [General Assembly campus in Atlanta](https://generalassemb.ly/education?where=atlanta).

As a current full-time student part of our tuition is effectively in-house credit for the [pretty wide range of workshops/events GA hosts](https://generalassemb.ly/education?).\n\nI decided to attend for two reasons:\n\n\n* Python is not taught in the Immersive Web Development curriculum\n\n* I knew Python has wide usage in particular fields and is a common 'first language' learned \n\n  * Python is used by students in the Data Immersive program at General Assembly and I had conversations with some of them about their experiences with Python. My prior exposure to it was mainly from my peers at Otago University who were studying science. Research scientists are a large user group of python.\n\n\nWalking into this bootcamp there were a number of positive/negative ideas which had been shared to me and I wasn't really informed enough to have an opinion on:\n\n* That Python was elegant and easier than other languages (indeed to the point it could spoil you against learning harder languages)\n\n* That Python was slow and 'bloated' and the reason for its adoption is really just the ease of use that overrides most performance concerns\n\n * However, there is a related argument/point that in fields such as data science and analytics human resources such as developer time are more scarce than processing power. Hence, sometimes it would be better to have a 'slow program' that produces the right result than one that requires more intensive developer time. This point was explicitly made by the instructor as a rationale for using Python despite its performance issues.\n\n**Format of the bootcamp:**\n\nThe Bootcamp went from 10-4pm with a lunch break.

Some interesting ones were:<ul>\n<li>Python is dynamically typed language, meaning it executes many things on runtime rather than could be executed during compilation. This can cause various side effects and errors. As one resource put it “if a program is statically typed, you know that certain types of errors are not possible”.</li>\n<li>Python has a large version split between user bases of 2.7 and 3.x , and that 2.7 requires a floating point in division is one of the first ‘gotchas’ associated with Python:</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"A-‘Gotcha’\"><a href=\"#A-‘Gotcha’\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"A ‘Gotcha’:\"></a><strong>A ‘Gotcha’:</strong></h2><p><strong>In Python 2.7 you may need to add a floating point for numbers to get have decimal usage or else you get some crazy errors/bugs…. this is ‘fixed in Python 3.x:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3/2 in Python 2.7:</strong><br><figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">x = 3</div><div class=\"line\">y = 2</div><div class=\"line\">print(x/y)</div><div class=\"line\">...</div><div class=\"line\">Out: 1</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>Wha?</p>\n<p><strong>3/2 in Python 3.x:</strong><br><figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">x = 3</div><div class=\"line\">y = 2</div><div class=\"line\">print(x/y)</div><div class=\"line\">...</div><div class=\"line\">Out: 1.5</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p><strong>To get the more correct 3/2 in Python 2.7…</strong><br><figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">x = 3</div><div class=\"line\">y = 2</div><div class=\"line\">print(x*1.0/y)</div><div class=\"line\">...</div><div class=\"line\">Out: 1.5</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>I can see how some of these apparently tiny but fundamental changes could make things break…</p>\n<p>In the class we touched on a lot in the class including usage of type, control flow, modules.

You can even get it down to 1-2 lines. Credit where credit is due.</p>\n<p><strong>Modules - i.e. Pandas for visualization we saw in class.</strong></p>\n<p>In Python we learned that modules really are just blocks of python that will be ‘pre-run’ in your terminal, introducing variables and so forth. They are not asynchronous/dynamically updating modules. </p>\n<p>In simple terms this means anytime an update is made to a module a fresh instance of Python is required with that module imported with its incorporated changes.</p>\n<p>Even just with the basic importing of Pandas however it was clear how much added functionality became possible for complex visualizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential application in my open source project:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Parsing XML</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>One issue I am considering closely is XML of NZ Legislation as part of an open-source project.

You can produce powerful, high quality work- but it takes place within some boundaries.</p>\n<p>This workflow does not seem apply as well to a dynamic, live, web development environment where latency in general should not exceed three seconds. This challenge is heightened as some web applications should be able to meet the needs of potentially millions of users at an ‘enterprise’ level.</p>\n<p>For this reason, learning a little bit of Python was great but re-affirmed the need to eventually learn some statically typed language such as C# to understand the ‘other side’ of computing where there is a lot more done up front by the developer to prevent performance issues that make up the bigger web applications of today.</p>\n<p>It still seems there is some truth to the idea that if things are easier there is usually some drawback somewhere for some purpose. But that is pretty vague too and shouldn’t let you get in the way of using the fun and easier tool if its appropriate! </p>\n<p>Anyways, a good introduction to Python!</p>\n"},{"title":"Parliamentary Counsel Office Meeting, August","id":"34","updated":"2016-08-22T19:36:36.000Z","date":"2016-08-18T22:37:37.000Z","_content":"\nProject [Legolas.nz](legolas.nz)\n\n---\n#####**A quick recap**\nIn case I haven't told you already... \n\n![Our humorous parody crest](http://legolas.nz/sites/default/files/sketch-crest.png)\n\nIt was great to read about the [2016 GovHack](https://www.govhack.org/) going smoothly.
