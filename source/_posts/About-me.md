*[I have been admitted but I do not hold a current practising certificate from the New Zealand Law Society. I cannot give legal advice, and there are very limited legal functions I can do. I would be the equivalent of an inactive lawyer of an American bar association.](https://www.lawsociety.org.nz/for-lawyers/joining-the-legal-profession/admitted-but-no-practising-certificate)*

*This means that I cannot currently offer legal services or describe myself as a lawyer under the High Courts jurisdiction. I cannot give legal advice unless I acquire a practising certificate, which I do not seek at this current time.*

I was flattered to be described on national radio as "Beau Murral, lawyer" after speaking to the Dunedin City Council in session but I made sure only to describe myself as an enrolled barrister and solicitor at the event and this report was mistaken... in two respects.[ National Radio,    "National online voting trial at risk after Dunedin pulls out" (22/09/2015) Radio New Zealand National](www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/201771586/national-online-voting-trial-at-risk-after-dunedin-pulls-out)

[Associate membership was granted under these rules](http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/8601/Rules-for-Associate-Membership-16.12.2014.pdf) that I had a significant relationship to the legal profession. This membership carries no entitlement to practice law.
