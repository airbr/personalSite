Happy to say I am on the list to volunteer at [PHP\[tek\] 2018](https://tek.phparch.com/). 

I have posted a few times on social media about how great I think volunteering at conferences can be. You get to meet people and make new connections in a good atmosphere as you are working together to make an event happen rather- it feels like a more kind of genuine kind of networking.

Looking forward to it !



As a side note- just recently I really passed my first year anniversary of working full time as a web developer- its nice to reflect on how far I have come. Volunteering I believe has been one ingredient in my success.
