Happy to say I am on the list to volunteer at [PHP\[tek\] 2018](https://tek.phparch.com/). 

I have posted a few times about how great I think volunteering at conferences can be. 

You get to meet people and make new connections in a good atmosphere. It feels better working together to make an event happen rather than just meeting people. It feels like a more kind of genuine kind of networking.

Learning to work with PHP has been one major milestone in my work as a developer for [EasyRx](https://www.easyrxortho.com).

Looking forward to it !

I recently passed my first year anniversary of working full time as a web developer. It is nice to reflect on how far I have come. Volunteering I believe has been one ingredient in my success.
