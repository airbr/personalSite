I am excited to say that I am slated to be attending the [Connect.Tech](http://connect.tech/) conference as a volunteer.

>THE SOUTHEAST’S PREMIER WEB & MOBILE DEV CONFERENCE
COBB GALLERIA • ATLANTA • OCTOBER 20-22, 2016


Currently in our course we are using Angular JS and there looks to be an excellent full stream of material about AngularJS (as well as React and others).

Ill make this page a static page and update as things happen! [I might as well say that the best thing that could happen is a job offer as a junior dev.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmurrah)

By the time of the conference, I should have a Project 3 to show from the following [early stage repository](https://github.com/benjaminwest1046/project3-fitness).
